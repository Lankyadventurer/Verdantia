The Orcish have been viewed time and time again by other races as violent and bloody. Within true settlements however, Orcs rarely have need for violence except for self-defense. Their culture is surprisingly civilized, being masters of Alchemy and Archaeology. The first human treasure hunters learned from Orcish scholars. Despite their cultured nature, Orcs still retain the fierceness they are known for by way of weapon augments and poisons. When crossed, it's best that their opponent watch their back. Choose this path if you want to study Arcana with devotion, learn about ancient civilization, or hold grudges.
