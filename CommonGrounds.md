The Common Grounds is an area on the massive island of Sonorous. It is used as a gathering place for many Adventurers, containing a Quest Board in the tavern, The Grand Flagon.

The barkeep, Danno Deviti, sells custom potions that he brews himself. Some are expensive, some are not. Some are useful, some are not.

Also in the area is a Windmill,
