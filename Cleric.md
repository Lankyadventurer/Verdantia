The role of a healer is perhaps the heaviest of all. It is your responsibility to keep your friends going, and level-headed. Though not ideally put on the front lines, you can still dish out average damage as well. Clerics tend to worship the old gods of the Overworld, and can often be found tending to the dilapidated shrines scattered throughout Verdantia.

Can only use Leather, Chainmail, or Gold armor.
