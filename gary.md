Gary The Deserter was once aligned with the Dark Sun Cult, yet somehow resisted their forces enough to escape during the Crystal Crisis. He provided valuable information for a group of adventurers pursuing the cult near the harbor of Teravale, and has since appeared in the Common Grounds during the harvest to peddle his unconventional wares. If you see a skeleton with a Blue hat, it's probably Gary!
