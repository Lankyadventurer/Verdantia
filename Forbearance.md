 
"Water is patient. Learn from it."

These are the teachings of the Temple of Forbearance, the origin point of many, if not all, Clerics. 
Near the Human settlement of Mistral, nestled among the myriad of small islands and Kelp, lies this Temple. It is completely submerged under the water, actually on the ocean floor. Protecting it is a powerful and ancient spell, said to be maintained by the Ocean herself. All travelers are welcome, and making the short swim down to the brightly lit and breathable hall is an easy task. 

Inside in the center is an Altar that accepts donations of coin, blessing the pious individual who makes an offering immediately, and the Ocean is kind enough to additionally extend the blessing to all Clerics. There are also several tools for Clerics to utilize for their own purposes. The Caretaker of the temple is Icarus Lavalto, a Human who lives closeby on the main Island of Mistral.
