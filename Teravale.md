Teravale is a small settlement to the south of Mistral. 

It is mostly abandoned, as it was pillaged by pirates and the forces of the Dark Sun Cult. 
Notable features are a strange tower that once housed arcane energy, a workshop of sorts that the Cult utilized to attempt research, and the Lavalto Inn, which is also empty. A large skeletal figure stood watch over the port, a warning to all who would anchor there.
