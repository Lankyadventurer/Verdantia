Humans are a stubborn race. Stubborn meaning that they refuse to die out. Humanity has been met with many events and calamities in the past that almost caused its extinction, yet it seems to spring back every time. Being avid explorers, adventurers, archaeologists, and diplomats, Humans tend to live their moderate lifespan to the fullest. Being a jack of all trades, any Human can take any profession - even if they may not excel. Choose this path if you don't quite fit anywhere else, or or haven't quite figured out who you are yet. All are welcome.
