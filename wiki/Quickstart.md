Here's a quick guide for getting started in Verdantia!

- [Optifine](https://optifine.net/downloads): Greatly enhances video settings. It's common to double your fps, and is needed for the resource pack.
- [Itembound](https://mods.curse.com/texture-packs/minecraft/252691-itembound-16x): Changes the appearance of certain items for greater immersion. Works like any other resource pack! Place this as the last resource pack if you have others.
- [Discord](https://discordapp.com/): A browser based app that can also be downloaded for greater functionality -- also with mobile options. This is our Realm's primary communication tool, and it greatly helps for organization. It will let you chat with others in public and private channels! You must make an account before being added to the Realm's channel. Get in contact with an Admin to be added once you do so.
