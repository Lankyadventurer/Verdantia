The Common Grounds is an area on the massive island of Sonorous. It is used as a gathering place for many Adventurers, containing a Quest Board in the tavern, The Grand Flagon.

The barkeep, Danno Deviti, sells custom potions that he brews himself. Some are expensive, some are not. Some are useful, some are not.

Also in the area is a Windmill, The Birch Brother's Sundry, a Bakery, and a shop that CERTAINLY DOES NOT sell weapons.

To return back home, Adventurers use the strange warp gate at the top of the hill.
