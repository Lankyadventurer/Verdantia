Strike fast. Strike true. `Rogues` are the quickest among other adventurers, though they sacrifice hardiness. Rogues tend to keep to themselves.

Rumor has it they have some `secret enclave` akin to the guild halls of other classes, but it would be unwise to expect warmth and familiarity from these individuals. Their daggers aren't just for show.

Can only use Leather or Chainmail armor.
