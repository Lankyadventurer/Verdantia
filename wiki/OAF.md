The Orcish Archaeological Foundation is one of dignity, intelligence, and applied research.

Based in the territory of Taiyra, this organization is devoted to the study of ancient sites, such as tombs, city ruins, remarkable land developments, or powerful artifacts from ages past.

Anyone can participate or aid the foundation. However, becoming an official member is a bit more of a tricky feat.
