Teravale is a small settlement to the south of Mistral.

It is mostly abandoned. Teravale was pillaged by pirates and the forces of the Dark Sun Cult.

Notable features include: a strange tower that once housed arcane energy, a workshop of sorts where the Cult attempted research, and the now-empty Lavalto Inn.

A large skeletal figure stands watch over the port -- a warning to all who would anchor there.
