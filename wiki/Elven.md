Fiercely protective of their roofed forests, Elves are a secluded people of arcane specialists. Although their lifespans are often exaggerated, they never truly live past 900 yet outlive most races.

The Elves try and maintain a tenuous peace with other races but are prone to infighting and political upheaval. Most of the fair folk find a career in some magical function; Elven warriors are terrifying in the deadly finesse they present.

Choose this path if you are fond of nature, love the arcane, or enjoy solitude now and again.
