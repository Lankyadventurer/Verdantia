The role of a healer is perhaps the heaviest of all. It is the responsibility of `Clerics` to keep their friends going and level-headed. Although they're not in the front lines, they can still dish out average damage.

Clerics tend to worship the `Old Gods of the Overworld` and can often be found tending to the `dilapidated shrines` scattered throughout `Verdantia`.

Can only use Leather, Chainmail, or Gold armor.
