Home to the Common Grounds, Sonorous is a large, densely forested, island.

A few threats have arisen there, such as a Flarachnid nest appearance, a strange vessel crash-landing on the shore, and some minor bandit threats.

Regardless, the villagers who made their homes in the Common Grounds were somehow drawn there and formed their own small community.
