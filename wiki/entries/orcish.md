The Orcish have been viewed time and time again by other races as violent and bloody. Within true settlements however, Orcs rarely have need for violence except for self-defense. Their culture is surprisingly civilized.

The Orchish are masters of Alchemy and Archaeology. The first human treasure hunters learned from Orcish scholars. Orcs still retain the fierceness and are known for their way of weapon augments and poisons. When crossed, it's best that their opponents watch their back.

Choose this path if you want to study Arcana with devotion, learn about ancient civilization, or hold grudges.
