Gary the Deserter, once aligned with the Dark Sun Cult, somehow resisted their forces and escaped during the Crystal Crisis. He provided valuable information for a group of adventurers pursuing the cult near the harbor of Teravale.

He has since appeared in the Common Grounds during the harvest to peddle his unconventional wares. If you see a skeleton with a `blue hat`, it's probably Gary!
