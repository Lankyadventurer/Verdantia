Powerful in spellcasting, `wizards` are few and far between. Their dabbling in magic learned through ancient tomes have been quite a boon.

Some focus on specific elements, while others have no focus and use wildly unpredictable magic. All of their spells are tied to `mystical wands`.

Can use Gold armor.
