Fiercely protective of their roofed forests, Elves are a secluded people of arcane specialists. Though their lifespans are often exaggerated, they never truly live past 900, outliving most races. The Elves try and maintain a tenuous peace with other races, but are prone to infighting and political upheaval fairly often. Though most of the fair folk find a career in some magical function, Elven warriors are terrifying in the deadly finesse they present. Choose this path if you are fond of nature, love the arcane, or enjoy solitude now and again.
