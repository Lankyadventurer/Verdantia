## Welcome to the Verdantia Wiki!

This is an attempt to create a much more friendly to use and read lore/feature details section for the server.
More to come soon!

## Introduction

This realm is one of adventure, heroes, and magic.
The ability to shape the world and it's outcome rests upon each player. On this server we expect players to come up with a character to present themselves as.
With the hope of bringing much versatility to individuals and their choices, the server is constantly developing and evolving.
We hope that you will be patient with us under such changes, but fear not, as the community is often gauged before any permanent decisions are made. 

Being a tight-knit community, it's easy for rules and expectations to go unspoken. For the betterment of the server, some rules and guidelines are listed below.
